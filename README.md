# MovieBot
Discord Bot which uses the OMDb API to fetch data from IMDb.
The user inputs a title on commmand and it sends an API call to the OMDb API which searches for the entry in the IMDb databases, and then it outputs fields of data such as the description, release date, genre, directors, writers, actors and poster.
# Commands
%movie [title] - search IMDb for a movie
%show [title] - search IMDb for a show
As the IMDb entries are extensive, make sure the title is as accurate as possible e.g '%movie Spider-Man' instead of '%movie Spiderman' to find the 2002 Sam Raimi movie.
